    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>A <strong>traditional</strong> paella Valenciana. I lived in Spain for two years where I was taught the art of making paella which originated in Valencia. I haven't found anything on here which is even close to authentic, so I thought I would add this recipe for those who would like to try a taste of Spain. First and foremost you will need a <i>special</i> paella pan called a paellera or just a paella. Trust me after you taste this you'll be glad you bought the special pan.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 (4 pound) whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces</li>
